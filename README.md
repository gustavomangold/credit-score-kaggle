# Credit score model
A credit score model based on the kaggle 'Give me Some Credit' dataset. Logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting and XGboost are used. Feature permutation is used to validate further the model, as well as hyperparameter tuning.
Everything is explained in the notebook, which comes with an associated library.
